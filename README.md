# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose
In this analysis, several years of Oahu temperature data for the months of June and December are statistically compared to assess sustainability of a possible business venture.

### Background
Surfing enthusiast W. Avy expressed an interest in opening a surf and ice cream shop in the Oahu area. Mr. Avy has requested additional temperature trends information to help inform his decision. 

## Results
A statistical assessment of the data showed three key differences concerning warm and cool weather trends.  Those findings are listed below.

### Warm Weather Differences
* June on average is warmer than December, with a mean temperature of roughly 75 degrees compared to December's near 71 degrees.
* June has a higher high, reaching a max of 85 degrees compared to December's 81 degrees.

### Cool Weather Differences
* December gets considerably cooler than June, with a low of 56 degrees while June hits its lowest at 64 degrees.

## Summary
### June and December Overall Temperature Trends
Although the dateset overall shows June to have higher highs than December and never as low lows, I propose performing additional queries to assess how June and December trend year-to-year. This would help us project into the future as to how these months' temperatures may trend in the future.

### Additional Queries
Below is an example of why additional queries may be beneficial. June's temperature reached its lowest point in 2016. Year-to-year comparisons could reveal whether June is trending colder.

Similarly, December's 2016 max temperature is notably lower than December's max overall.
